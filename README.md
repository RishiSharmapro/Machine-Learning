# ü§ñ Machine Learning Learning Journey  **by Rishi Sharma (@rishisharmapro)**

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! üöÄ  
This repo documents my personal journey into the world of **Machine Learning**, starting from foundational libraries like `NumPy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`. It includes hands-on notebooks, small projects, and visualizations.
